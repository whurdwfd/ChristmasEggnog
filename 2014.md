# ChristmasEggnog - 2014
Our Christmas Eggnog Recipe. We've been perfecting this recipe since 2009.

### Ingredients
* 4 Eggs
* 2 Cups Whipping Cream
* 3/4 Cups Sugar
* 2 Cups Whiskey
* 3/4 Cups White Rum
* 1/4 Cup Vodka
* 1 t. Nutmeg
* 1 t. Saigon Cinnamon
* 1/2 t. Cloves (ground)
* 1 t. Bourbon Vanilla

### Instructions
* Beat the **egg yolks** with a mixer, slowly adding **all the sugar**. Beat until creamy and light yellow.
* Stir **Alcohol**, **Milk**, and **Half of the Cream** into the **Egg Mixture**
* In a separate bowl whip the **other half of the whipping cream** until lightly whipped. (Body but no peaks. We use our Bosh mixer with the whisps for 1 minute on speed 2.)
* _Whisk_ **whipped cream** into **egg/alcohol mixture**. (**NOTE:** If you pour the milk right into the alcohol it WILL curdle)
* Add the **Spices** and **Vanilla**
* Refridgerate till ready to serve.

### Other Notes
Often times we mix up the batch and do a taste test to see how it is. We might add whiskey or tequila for tha special back of the throat bite or cut with a little milk if it's coming on too strong. Mixing in sugar and/or vanilla can also impact the flavor.

One batch makes aprox 1.75 liters.

#### Alcohol Brands We Use
The aclohol is up to you but we've had best luck using the following. Our goal is for this to be a smooth drink that's warm going down. It can have a habbit of sneaking up on you.

* Whiskey - Evan Williams or Ezra Brooks (nothin special really, just a little more smooth than Jack Daniels I think)
* Vodka - Monopoolwa - Potato Vodka is super smooth and realy compliments.
* Tequila - Jose Quervo Silver
* Rum - Bacardi White
